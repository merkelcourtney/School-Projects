            <h2>Why make this?</h2>

            <p>I&rsquo;ve been a baking enthusiast since before I can even remember. In fact, you can find a picture of
                me trying to help my mom in the kitchen with an electric mixer at age two. All this to say, that in some
                twenty-odd years, I&rsquo;ve made my way around the kitchen and baked everything from cupcake flops to
                experimental macarons. But the pinnacle of baking &mdash; the gold standard if you will &mdash; is a
                kick-ass chocolate chip cookie. Sure, <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.verybestbaking.com/recipes/18476/original-nestle-toll-house-chocolate-chip-cookies/">Nestle&rsquo;s
                    Tollhouse premade dough or recipe</a> somehow always hits the spot, but if you want to distinguish
                yourself as a competent baker, you&rsquo;ve got to have a unique and successful chocolate chip cookie
                recipe in your toolkit. Well, for me, this is mine.</p>

            <p>From the way the saltiness hits your palate, to the large pockets of chocolate, and everything in
                between, you can expect this to become a recipe that your friends and family beg you to make for every
                event. Part of what makes it so successful is leaving the dough to sit and refrigerate, absorbing and
                melding all the flavors, beating until pale for a great texture and finishing with the salt. Don&rsquo;t
                skip over these steps!

                        <h3>Directions</h3>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until it foams, then
                                browns, 5&ndash;8 minutes. Scrape into a large bowl and let cool slightly.</li>
                            <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, and kosher salt in a medium bowl.</li>
                            <li>Add brown sugar and granulated sugar to browned butter. Using an electric mixer on
                                medium speed, beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add eggs and vanilla, increase
                                mixer speed to medium-high, and beat until mixture lightens and begins to thicken, about
                                1 minute. Reduce mixer speed to low; add dry ingredients and beat just to combine. Mix
                                in toffee pieces and chocolate wafers with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Let dough
                                sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate. Dough will
                                look very loose at first, but will thicken as it sits.</li>
                            <li>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375&deg;. Using a 1 &frac12;-oz. ice cream
                                scoop, portion out 10 balls of dough and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet,
                                spacing about 3" apart (you can also form dough into ping pong–sized balls with your
                                hands). Do not flatten; cookies will spread as they bake. Sprinkle with sea salt.</li>
                            <li>Bake cookies until edges are golden brown and firm but centers are still soft,
                                9&ndash;11 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack
                                and let cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough and a fresh parchment-lined baking
                                sheet to make 10 more cookies.</li>
                        </ol>

            <h3>Do Ahead</h3>
            <p class="last-paragraph">Cookie dough can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill. If formed into balls, wait
                to add salt until just before baking. Let dough come to room temperature before putting into the oven.
