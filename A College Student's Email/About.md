# A College Student's Email Project
## The project description:
In this project you will create a scene on the Internet with a careful attention to detail so that users will discover a rich world and/or narrative as they navigate through your space. It must convey a deep and critical experience through observation of details in an Internet space. Think about how you already interact with the Internet in your daily life. In what ways can you subvert or complicate this online routine? Think about what makes discovering information on the Internet a unique experience and how your Internet scene is part of a physical, historical, or narrative interaction with web space.  The content can be whatever you wish, but it must draw attention to the idea that discovering visual, audio, or hyperlink clues on your webpage helps to uncover new meaning in the artwork. How can the action of clicking, stumbling across unexpected moments, or linking to new places change the artwork’s content? Or, would you prefer for your viewer to have a directed experience, in which they only have one choice (or the semblance of one choice?) How does that affect the content? Creating a narrative is acceptable, but use the narrative as a vehicle for a deeper critical message that addresses web interactivity directly. 

## What I demonstrated:
- Careful attention to the images and sounds that create the scene 
- Consistent aesthetic tone development
- Creation of a scene that provides a critical experience for the viewer’s interaction 
- Clean, well-written code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Instructor's comments:
"Great job, Courtney. This was another strong project. I found the restricted use of the Gmail interface to be anxiety-inducing on it's own. The engagement with a website I am so familiar with and not be able to control it was a great start. The additional interactions on the emails themselves made it even worse. Your project gave me the sense that Gmail makes it's own judgements and choices, and I only appear to have control over it. Very well done."
