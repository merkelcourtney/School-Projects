# Acetaminophen Interactive Graphic Project
## The project description:
The main goal is to successfully recreate a 2013 ProPublica interactive data graphic: https://projects.propublica.org/drug-labels/. Design the layout using CSS Grid, and populate the HTML with data using JavaScript. Create effects for the photos in the grid, and design a flawless progress bar that updates appropriately. 

## What I demonstrated:
- Objects and arrays in JavaScript
- CSS Grid structure
- forEach() and callback functions
- Adding event listeners
- Extensive 'if' statements
- Manipulating inner HTML & CSS from JavaScript file
