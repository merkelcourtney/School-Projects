                <p>A fancy word for getting the flavor off the bottom of the pot or pan you just seared something in.
                    Once you're done searing the meat, if you pour something like broth or wine into the pan and begin
                    to scrape, the flavor begins to impart itself into the liquid, multiplying the flavor.

                <p>Get a meat thermometer! Make sure to stick it into the thickest part of the meat and make sure it
                    reaches the FDA-approved temperature for the meat you are cooking. Chicken needs to be 165º
                    internally, pork needs to be at least 145º internally and steak can range anywhere from 125º and up.
                    Cook your ground beef til there's no pink remaining, though. That is, unless you're making burgers,
                    in which case I would try 160º.

                <p class="header">When to use butter versus oil?</p>
                <p>Butter is great for melting and cooking in (like a meat or veggie) when you aren't using it over high
                    heat for a long amount of time. Butter can be burned fairly easy, so it's not a great idea to put it
                    in a ripping hot oven. For cooking over high heat or in a super hot oven, I recommend using a
                    neutral oil like canola, vegetable or grapeseed which have higher smoke points (which means it takes
                    a higher temp to burn them). Olive oil tends to be a happy medium when in doubt!

                <p>Never ever EVER use something metal or abrasive! Wooden or plastic utensils are safe and won't
                    scratch off the coating, which could put the nasty chemicals in your food.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p class="header">If a recipe calls for wine, how do I choose which one?</p>
                <p>Recipes will typically tell you what category (like red or white), or may even be specific with a
                    type (like Cabernet Sauvignon or Pinot Grigio). It's best to use what they specifically call for if
                    it is noted. However, if it is vague like "white wine", use something that you would feel
                    comfortable drinking (cheapest wine equals cheapest tasting food) and make sure that it matches the
                    flavor profile of the dish. Cooking something savory? Be sure to get a dry wine, as to not add
                    sweetness where it doesn't belong. Making something that benefits from sweet notes? Consider using
                    semi-dry or a sweet wine – just keep in mind that as the liquid condenses, the sweeter the flavor.
                    In my opinion, it's always best to choose the drier side when you don't know what to pick.

                <p class="header">Should you salt pasta water?</p>
                <p>Yes yes YES! It's a common saying... your pasta water should be salty like the sea. Bring your water
                    to a boil first as putting salt in beforehand can marginally slow down how long it takes to boil
                    (*~SCIENCE~*). Don't feel too bad putting 1/4 cup of salt in several quarts of water. It flavors
                    your pasta as it cooks!

                <p class="header">I have no idea the best way to marinade... help!</p>
                <p>Follow this rule of thumb: salt, fat, acid and some sweet. Make sure to put it in a container or bag
                    that won't break or absorb the marinade as it will sit there for a while. Coat what you're
                    marinating in a good amount of fat to coat (like olive oil), and put in half the amount of that fat
                    in acid (like lemon juice or apple cider vinegar). Remember to add in your pepper or other dried
                    spices, and just drizzle in a small amount of sweet (like brown sugar, honey or maple syrup). Salt
                    can be added in the form of plain salt or more creative like soy sauce. You can always google ratios
                    if you need help! Meats can marinade pretty safely for up to 2 days in the fridge, but about an hour
                    is all you need! The flavor doesn't increase a ton after that first hour of marinating.

                <p class="header">Do I wash chicken before cooking?</p>
                <p>NO! It's kind of an old thing that our grandparents and parents were taught, but if you're cooking
                    your chicken to the correct internal temperature (165º), then that liquid that leaks off during
                    cooking won't have any bacteria any more! In fact, rinsing it increases the chance that you're
                    spreading salmonella all over your sink that could spread to other things later.
